Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.",883.0,306

2,29415640,chr2,29192774,,,"Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",648.0,499

17,7577062,chr17,7673744,,,"This conserved domain mutation variant covers mutations in regions of p53 reported to be highly conserved during evolution. These regions span codons 117-143 (region II), 171-181 (region III), 234-258 (region (IV), and 270-286 (region V). Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.",15.0,1300

3,10191507,chr3,10149823,G,A,R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.,95.0,1739

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",27.0,2660

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",30.5,2678

The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(2;9)(p12.3;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, includes the leucine zipper of RANBP2 and the tyrosine kinase of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in several juvenile and young adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further classified as BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Most of the documented patients were treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (specifically dasatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, but they eventually experienced relapse and succumbed to their disease. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",10.0,3268

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The most commonly published breakpoint joins exon 18 of ZMIZ1 to exon 2 of ABL1 (ZMIZ1-ABL1 18-2). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(9;10)(q34.12;q22.3) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that upregulates the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Patients harboring the ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion are hypothesized to be eligible for imatinib therapy.",32.5,3269
